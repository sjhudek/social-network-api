# Challenge #18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## User Story

AS A new social media platform,

I WANT a behind-the-scenes system that can effortlessly manage and organize the vast and varied information from our users,

SO THAT our website can provide a smooth and efficient experience, even as we grow and have millions of users sharing all sorts of content.

## What You Can Expect:

- Starting Up:
 - - When you kick things off with the right command, our system will not only start up but also make sure everything's in sync with our MongoDB database using Mongoose.

- Viewing User Info:
- - Curious about user details or thoughts? Just use the API GET routes. You'll see all the data neatly presented in a JSON format, making it both readable and technically sound.

- Adding & Changing Stuff:
- - With our API POST and PUT routes, you can effortlessly add or modify users and thoughts. And if you ever need to remove something? The DELETE route has got your back.

- Interacting with Thoughts:
- - Using the API POST route, you can add reactions to thoughts or even add new friends to a user's list. And if you ever want to undo? The DELETE route lets you remove reactions or friends with ease.
