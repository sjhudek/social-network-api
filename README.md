# Challenge #18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## User Story

AS A new social media platform,

I WANT a behind-the-scenes system that can effortlessly manage and organize the vast and varied information from our users,

SO THAT our website can provide a smooth and efficient experience, even as we grow and have millions of users sharing all sorts of content.

## What You Can Expect:

- Starting the Server:
- - When I run the application command, the server starts:
- - - the Mongoose models are synchronized with the MongoDB database.

- Viewing User and Thought Data:
- - When I use Insomnia to access the API's GET routes for users and thoughts:
- - - the data for these routes appears in a nicely formatted JSON.

- Managing User and Thought Data:
- - When I use Insomnia to interact with the API's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes:
- - - I can create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.

- Reacting to Thoughts and Managing Friends:
- - When I use Insomnia to test the API's POST and DELETE routes:
- - - I can add or remove reactions to thoughts.
- - - I can also add or remove friends from a user's friend list successfully.
